# 关于我们 / About

[Team NED](https://github.com/MoHaDouBiTeam) (formerly known as MoHaDouBiTeam) is a group of GregTech players from China. As the lines growing rapidly and for other reasons, Team Amamiya quitted translating GregTech 6 into Simplified Chinese. To make this excellent mod more accessible to players speaking Chinese, we took over this localization project in July 2016. With the help of a simple regex replacer and Travis CI, we are updating actively following the development of GregTech 6, currently covering ≥95% of the text.
